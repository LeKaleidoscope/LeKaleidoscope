- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeKaleidoscope, and yeah I'm french. So sorry for your eyes, I don't speak (or write) in English genuinely. 
- 👀 I’m interested in coding for modding in GTA RP. Also in animation & modelisation. And I work in videos for a few years.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Lua (also Blender)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my project essentially & anything related to GTA RP. But try me, I'm also curious...
- 📫 How to reach me ? On Discord ("@lekaleidoscope")
- 😄 Pronouns: Usually "he/him/his". But that's up to you, I really don't care.
- ⚡ Fun fact: In games I usually drive bikes, but IRL I prefer to drive trucks over anything else.
